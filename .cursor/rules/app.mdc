* VanJS State Reactivity: Whenever you reference `.val` of a state variable, the enclosing function will automatically re-execute when that state changes. This can cause bugs where initialization functions run repeatedly. To limit the re-rendering scope, wrap state access in a nested function - this confines the reactivity to just that inner function rather than the entire enclosing function.

* Prefer tailwind-style symantic styling over inline styles. Add classes to [styles.css](mdc:src/styles.css) or use CSS modules for component-specific styling which cannot be generalized
